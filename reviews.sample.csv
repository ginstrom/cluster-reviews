m/0814255,Ben McEachen,False,Sunday Mail (Australia),Fresh,3.5/5,2010-02-09,"Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?"
m/0814255,Ethan Alter,True,Hollywood Reporter,Rotten,,2010-02-10,"What's really lacking in The Lightning Thief is a genuine sense of wonder, the same thing that brings viewers back to Hogwarts over and over again."
m/0814255,David Germain,True,Associated Press,Rotten,,2010-02-10,It's more a list of ingredients than a movie-magic potion to enjoy from start to finish.
m/0814255,Nick Schager,False,Slant Magazine,Rotten,1/4,2010-02-10,Harry Potter knockoffs don't come more transparent and slapdash than this wannabe-franchise jumpstarter directed by Chris Columbus.
m/0814255,Bill Goodykoontz,True,Arizona Republic,Fresh,3.5/5,2010-02-10,"Percy Jackson isn't a great movie, but it's a good one, trotting out kernels of Greek mythology like so many Disney Channel references."

m/0814255,Jim Schembri,True,The Age (Australia),Fresh,3/5,2010-02-10,"Crammed with dragons, set-destroying fights and things exploding, [Columbus] squeezes in a few well-meaning pause breaks about friendship and absent fathers before swiftly moving on to the next pyrotechnics display."
m/0814255,Mark Adams,False,Daily Mirror (UK),Fresh,4/5,2010-02-10,"This action-packed fantasy adventure, based on Rick Riordan's hit Percy Jackson and the Olympians series of books, is great fun, and deserves to find an audience with teens now bereft of any Harry Potter magic."
m/0814255,Roger Moore,True,Orlando Sentinel,Rotten,2/4,2010-02-10,"For what it is and for whom it is intended, it's not a bad movie, just an indifferent one."
m/0814255,David Jenkins,True,Time Out,Rotten,2/5,2010-02-10,"Chris Columbus returns to his comfort zone for this mirthless, episodic fantasy saga based on the young-reader book series by Rick Riordan."
m/0814255,Joshua Tyler,False,CinemaBlend,Fresh,3/5,2010-02-11,The best thing you can say about Chris Columbus's adaptation is that he's incapable of destroying whatever magic and wonder it is in these books that has kept kids coming back for more.
m/0814255,Peter Paras,False,E! Online,Rotten,C,2010-02-11,This cast is simply too generic. None of the young thespians stick out.
m/0814255,Vic Holtreman,False,Screen Rant,Fresh,3.5/5,2010-02-11,"Percy Jackson may not be ""Harry Potter good,"" but kids will really enjoy it and parents will be happy to have a moviethey can bring them to that's family-friendly."
m/0814255,MaryAnn Johanson,False,Flick Filosopher,Fresh,,2010-02-11,"[P]erfectly inoffensive, occasionally clever... It's in the few genuinely cinematically joyful moments, the ones that do rise above the formula, that you realize how much more this could have been..."
m/0814255,Mark Dujsik,False,Mark Reviews Movies,Rotten,2.5/4,2010-02-11,"Admirably, the movie isn't bogged down in the exposition common to first entries, but at the end, it's a franchise searching for its voice."
m/0814255,Nell Minow,False,Beliefnet,Fresh,B,2010-02-11,The main thing this movie seems to be missing is classically trained British actors.
m/0814255,Mary Elizabeth Williams,True,Salon.com,Rotten,,2010-02-11,"When the movie slows down to catch its breath, there's very little of the heart and soul -- and wry wit -- that make the Riordan books so beloved."
m/0814255,Dustin Putman,False,TheFilmFile.com,Fresh,2.5/4,2010-02-11,"Imperfect, yes, but also both suitably imaginative and entertaining. Works as action-adventure razzle-dazzle, coming-of-age tale, and beginners' lesson on Greek mythology."
m/0814255,Stephen Holden,True,New York Times,Rotten,2/5,2010-02-11,"Although the standard allegorical bases for mythical-quest movies are dutifully covered, the obvious similarity of Percy Jackson to the Harry Potter movies inevitably makes it feel somewhat secondhand."
m/0814255,Jeffrey M. Anderson,False,Combustible Celluloid,Rotten,1/4,2010-02-11,"A little bit worse than lifeless; it's clueless, like a Medusa running around with her head cut off."

m/0814255,Kenneth Turan,True,Los Angeles Times,Rotten,2/5,2010-02-11,"This is generic filmmaking at its most banal, a simple-minded simplification of a not overwhelmingly complex book."
m/0814255,Moira MacDonald,True,Seattle Times,Rotten,2/4,2010-02-11,"Kids may well enjoy the adventures of The Lightning Thief on screen, but I think most readers will prefer the movie in their imaginations."
m/0814255,James Rocchi,True,MSN Movies,Fresh,3/5,2010-02-11,An attempt to steal some of Harry Potter's thunder that also stands on its own as a well-made large-scale adventure that works well enough to entertain the teens it's hoping to strike.

m/0814255,David Plotz,True,Slate,Rotten,,2010-02-11,Columbus directs with his usual frying pan to the head. Music is forever swelling majestically. Characters are always opening wide their eyes and mouths to gaze in wonder.

m/0814255,Andrea Gronvall,True,Chicago Reader,Rotten,,2010-02-11,The movie feels like a cut-rate Potter knockoff with a dash of Ray Harryhausen.
m/0814255,Tasha Robinson,True,AV Club,Rotten,C-,2010-02-11,"In Columbus' hands, it once again all breaks down into a series of rushed, breathless special-effects setpieces, in a thrill ride that isn't headed anywhere new."
m/0814255,Rene Rodriguez,True,Miami Herald,Fresh,2.5/4,2010-02-11,The Lightning Thief makes the idea of a sequel seem like an inviting proposition.
m/0814255,Kent Turner,False,School Library Journal,Fresh,2.75/5,2010-02-11,"Columbus aims at nothing more than providing a rambunctious romp. He nimbly avoids the fate that has snared other film adaptations, like Eragon and Inkheart."

m/0814255,Michael Phillips,True,Chicago Tribune,Rotten,2/4,2010-02-11,"Even with all its computer-generated fireballs, it's lukewarm medium-budget blockbustering."
m/0814255,Matt Pais,False,Metromix.com,Rotten,2/5,2010-02-11,"The disappearance of lightning simply is not interesting, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians sounds more like a '70s funk band than a kid's series."
m/0814255,Roger Ebert,True,Chicago Sun-Times,Fresh,3/4,2010-02-11,Uma Thurman demonstrates she can wear a snake-covered head as gracefully as Pierce Brosnan can trot around with a horse's netherlands.
m/0814255,Rich Cline,False,Shadows on the Wall,Fresh,3/5,2010-02-11,The Greek-gods premise lets the filmmakers indulge in some visually whizzy sequences that keep this rather lightweight action movie entertaining.
m/0814255,Fionnuala Halligan,False,Screen International,Fresh,,2010-02-11,"Of all the players, Uma Thurman channels the Bride to deliver a Medusa the children won't easily forget when it comes to bedtime."
m/0814255,Matthew Turner,False,ViewLondon,Fresh,3/5,2010-02-11,"Enjoyable, nicely paced family adventure with likeable characters, a strong central premise and some decent set-pieces, though the plot's a little hazy in places and the humour doesn't always work."
m/0814255,Peter Debruge,True,Variety,Fresh,,2010-02-11,"Action movies of this scale often start off strong and wind down to forgettable finales, but Percy Jackson is the opposite, overcoming a clunky setup to deliver nearly all its thrills in the last half-hour."
m/0814255,Diva Velez,False,TheDivaReview.com,Rotten,2.5/5,2010-02-12,The Lightning Thief is all crass ineptitude and lost potential. Columbus' infantilizing of any character depth and use of leftover Harry Potter special effects will amuse only the smallest in your pantheon.
m/0814255,Christopher Smith,False,Bangor Daily News (Maine),Rotten,C,2010-02-12,"The plot is a pretty blatant rehash of the typical ""coming-of-age hero"" tropes. Still, while ""Percy Jackson"" may not end up being the next huge and successful franchise, at the very least, it was an honest and amusing two hours."
m/0814255,Brian Tallerico,False,Movie Retriever,Rotten,,2010-02-12,"Young viewers probably will be entertained but even they are likely to realize that this could have and should have been better, especially by the time they're old enough to drive."
m/0814255,Walter Chaw,False,Film Freak Central,Rotten,1/4,2010-02-12,It raises issues it doesn't have the balls to resolve by placing them in a context it doesn't have the brains to exploit.

m/0814255,Jenna Busch,False,Newsarama,Rotten,5.5/10,2010-02-12,My problems with it are the same as with most screen adaptations of young adult novels...they spend so much time struggling to explain the world they're creating that they forget which parts of the story people want to see...they figure that people (kids)

m/0814255,Carrie R. Wheadon,False,Common Sense Media,Rotten,2/5,2010-02-12,Too scary for younger fans of the popular book.
m/0814255,Andrea Chase,False,Killer Movie Reviews,Fresh,3/5,2010-02-12,The pleasant surprise is how deftly the story translates the myths from their classical idiom into modern ones and without losing the classical flavor
m/0814255,Daniel M. Kimmel,False,North Shore Movies,Fresh,3.5/5,2010-02-12,"...great fun for the whole family. And if it introduces you and any young readers in your home to the books, so much the better."

m/0814255,Brian Orndorf,False,BrianOrndorf.com,Rotten,C,2010-02-12,"A clunky kid-sized epic, able to conjure colossal acts of Greek myth wonderment, but never brave enough to shut its pie hole and let the audience process the screen magic."
m/0814255,Steven D. Greydanus,False,Decent Films Guide,Fresh,B-,2010-02-12,Harry Potter meets Clash of the Titans … The backdrop of Greek mythology makes an enjoyable change of pace from the medieval fantasy magic of the Potter stories.
m/0814255,Willie Waffle,False,WaffleMovies.com,Rotten,1.5/4,2010-02-12,"While winning the award for longest movie title, it is a film that only goes through the motions."
m/0814255,Sonny Bunch,False,Washington Times,Fresh,2.5/4,2010-02-12,Not without bright moments ... but the story is centered around a trio of young actors who simply aren't operating at the same skill level as their older costars.
m/0814255,Drew McWeeny,False,HitFix,Fresh,,2010-02-12,"Built with set pieces that demonstrate a real affection for Greek myth iconography and centered on a strong performance by Logan Lerman (a star in the making), Percy Jackson & The Olympians aims young and hits the target fairly consistently."
m/0814255,Marshall Fine,False,Hollywood & Fine,Rotten,,2010-02-12,It's not awful. It's just not particularly inspired. Something tells me this movie won't be inspiring a sequel anytime soon.

m/0814255,Linda Barnard,True,Toronto Star,Rotten,2.5/4,2010-02-12,"Unfortunately, the movie lacks that good old Potter charm, trading Harry's dark whimsy for a handful of CGI magic beans."
m/0814255,Chris Hewitt,False,St. Paul Pioneer Press,Fresh,3/4,2010-02-12,"There are lots of cool surprises along the way, and the special effects are fantastic, especially the ones that create Uma Thurman's Medusa snakedo."

m/0814255,Jen Yamato,False,Movies.com,Rotten,2.5/5,2010-02-13,"Director Columbus never quite gets comfortable juggling the film's myriad characters, grandiose-but-stale CGI effects, and PG-friendly battle scenes, speeding headlong through endless plot points rather than taking the time to make any of them matter."
m/0814255,Michelle Alexandria,False,Eclipse Magazine,Fresh,B-,2010-02-13,"This is what a quality book adaptation should do, stand on it's own, while making you want to explore more. But JESUS! Can we stop the Apple Product Placements! I don't want to see a freaking iPhone in a Fantasy film!!!"
